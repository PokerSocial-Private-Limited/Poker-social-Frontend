          <p>
            Poker Social is an online social networking platform for poker
            enthusiasts from all across the globe. It has been designed to give
            its users a user-friendly environment to share their poker
            experiences, connect with poker lovers and build a community of
            poker players to learn and grow together.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a responsible service provider, we understand the importance of
            our usersâ€™ interest and that is why we have designed certain
            Community Guidelines that enable you to become a responsible user at
            Poker Social by uploading, publishing, and promoting positive,
            friendly, and abuse-free (in any context) user-generated content and
            any other activity on our platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            These guidelines act as a living document to guide our users to
            uphold their righteous conduct and we ensure that we update, modify
            and repair this document in accordance with the evolution of the
            Poker Social community and services. There may be additional
            guidelines or specific exceptions applicable for certain services or
            properties under the Poker Social Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poker Social gives its users the right to{' '}
            <strong>of expression</strong> on its platform. However, this right
            must be used in right conduct not relating to hurt, defame, insult,
            abuse, harass, molest, misuse, offend, exploit, or any such action
            or in any way breach of any of the Poker Social Community Guidelines
            that is not acceptable by Poker Social may result in the suspension
            of such account, removal of content, a strike on the account at any
            time for any conduct that we tend to confirm to be inappropriate or
            harmful in any context. We reserve the right to take any of the
            above-mentioned actions to protect the integrity of our community.
            The guidelines that describe various circumstances or events for the
            suspension of the account at Poker Social are given below in detail.
          </p>
          <h4>Breaking the Law</h4>

          <p>
            You must respect and abide by the native, national, and
            international laws as applicable while using our services. Any
            content or activity that involves encouraging, offering, or
            soliciting illegal activity including committing or aiding in the
            malicious destruction, defacement, or theft of public or another
            personâ€™s private property without permission is prohibited.
          </p>
          <h4>Suspension Evasion</h4>
          <p>
            All suspensions will be in force until their expiration or removal
            upon successful appeal. Any user making an attempt to use other
            accounts, identities, or by appearing on another userâ€™s account to
            circumvent an account suspension will lead to additional enforcement
            against such usersâ€™ accounts up to an indefinite suspension. It is
            prohibited to knowingly advertise or feature any suspended user on
            your account.
          </p>
          <h4>Violence, Incitement, and Self-Destructive Behaviour</h4>
          <p>
            Any activity that leads to danger to your life or any other
            individualâ€™s life including, but is not limited to: suicide
            threats, intentional physical trauma, self-destruction, incitement
            to cause such activities that lead to a userâ€™s physical harm or
            danger to life is prohibited on Poker Social. Publishing, uploading,
            featuring, or promoting any such kind of content is strictly
            prohibited and may lead to account suspension by Poker Social. In
            addition to this if any user
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>attempts or threats to hack, DDOS, or SWAT others</li>
            <li>
              use of weapons to physically threaten, intimidate, harm, or kill
              others
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Poker Social is not going to tolerate such acts and would suspend
            their accounts for an indefinite period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poker Social strictly prohibits content that depicts, glorifies,
            encourages, or supports acts of terrorism, or violent extremist
            acts. This includes threatening or encouraging others to commit acts
            that will lead to serious physical damage to teams of individuals or
            important property destruction. You are also not allowed to show or
            link terrorist or extremist information, together with graphic
            photos or footage of terrorist or extremist violence, even for the
            need of denouncing such content.
          </p>

          <h4>Hateful Conduct and Harassment</h4>
          <p>
            Poker Social is highly against any hateful conduct and harassment on
            its platform. Hateful conduct is any content or activity that
            promotes or encourages discrimination, denigration, harassment, or
            violence based on the following protected characteristics: race,
            ethnicity, color, caste, national origin, immigration status,
            religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
            disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status. We also
            provide certain protections for age. We strongly oppose hateful
            conduct and have zero tolerance for the same, meaning we take action
            on every valid reported instance of hateful conduct. We offer every
            user equal protection under this policy, regardless of their
            particular characteristics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harassment has many manifestations, including stalking, personal
            attacks, promotion of physical harm, hostile raids, and malicious
            false report brigading. Sexual harassment, specifically, can take
            the form of unwelcome sexual advances and solicitations, sexual
            objectification, or degrading attacks relating to a personâ€™s
            perceived sexual practices. We suspend such accounts and remove the
            content that promotes hateful conduct and harassment, with
            increasing severity of enforcement when the behavior is targeted,
            personal, graphic, or repeated/prolonged, incites further abuse, or
            involves threats of violence or coercion.
          </p>
          <h4>Unauthorized Sharing of Private Information</h4>
          <p>
            Infringing others privacy is not tolerated at Poker Social. We
            prohibit sharing content that may reveal private personal
            information about individuals, or their private property, without
            permission. This includes but is not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Sharing personally identifiable information (such as real name,
              location, or ID)
            </li>
            <li>
              Sharing restricted or protected social profiles or any information
              from those profiles
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If a user invades another userâ€™s privacy then it will lead to
            account suspension for an indefinite period and removal of such
            content.
          </p>

          <h4>Impersonation</h4>

          <p>
            Any content or activity which is meant to impersonate an individual
            or organization is prohibited. Any attempts made to misrepresent
            yourself as a member of Poker Social or its representative is a
            zero-tolerance violation and will result in indefinite suspension.
          </p>

          <h4>Spam, Scams, and Other Malicious Conduct</h4>
          <p>
            We prohibit any content or activity that disrupts, interrupts,
            harms, or otherwise violates the integrity of Poker Social services
            or another userâ€™s experience or devices. Such activity includes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Posting large amounts of repetitive, unwanted messages or user
              reports
            </li>
            <li>Distributing unauthorized advertisements</li>
            <li>Phishing</li>
            <li>Defrauding others</li>
            <li>Spreading malware or viruses</li>
            <li>
              Misinformation (such as feigning distress, posting misleading
              metadata)
            </li>
            <li>
              Tampering (such as artificially inflating follow or live viewer
              stats)
            </li>
            <li>Selling or sharing user accounts</li>
            <li>Reselling Poker Social services or features</li>
            <li>
              Defacing, or attempting to deface, website pages or other Poker
              Social services (such as uploading inappropriate or malicious
              content)
            </li>
            <li>Cheating our rewards system</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Any attempt at such activities may result in an indefinite
            suspension.
          </p>

          <h4>Nudity, Pornography, and Other Sexual Content</h4>

          <p>
            We prohibit the display of nudity and sexually explicit content or
            activities, such as pornography, sexual acts or intercourse, and
            sexual services at Poker Social. Sexually suggestive content or
            activities are also prohibited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the content or activities that threaten or promote sexual
            violence or exploitation are strictly prohibited and may be reported
            to law enforcement. Child exploitation will be reported to the
            concerned authorities and will also lead to indefinite suspension of
            such Poker Social accounts.
          </p>
          <h4>Intellectual Property Rights</h4>
          <p>
            We suggest you not share the content that infringes someoneâ€™s
            intellectual property right involving the dissemination or sharing
            of any third-party content, derivative creations, or copyrighted
            content. We encourage you to share the content that you own or is
