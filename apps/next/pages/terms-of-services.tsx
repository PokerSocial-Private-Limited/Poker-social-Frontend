            <li>
              We need your permission to use and share the content that you
              create. It includes the content that you share or upload, such as
              photos or videos, which may be protected by intellectual property
              laws.
              <p>
                You own the intellectual property rights (things such as
                copyrights or trademarks) in any Content that you create and
                share on Poker Social. There is nothing in these Terms that
                terminates your rights to your Content. You are free to share
                your content with anyone you want wherever you want.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, in order to provide our services, you must give us
                certain legal permissions (called 'licenses') to use this
                content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and
                improving our products and services, as set forth in the above
                sections.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, when you share, post, or upload content that is
                protected by intellectual property rights on or in relation to
                our services or products, you may inform us about your content
                (your privacy and application non-exclusive, transferable,
                sub-licensable to host, use, distribute, modify, play, copy,
                publicly display or display, translate or create derivative
                works thereof, Offers surcharge-free and worldwide license).
                This means, for example, if you share a photo on Poker Social,
                you allow us to store, copy and share it with other people
                (again, depending on your settings) with service providers that
                support our services. This license will terminate once your
                content is removed from our systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can remove the entire content at once by deleting the
                content or deleting your account. You can download a replica of
                your data at any time before deleting your account.
              </p>

                When you delete content, it is not visible to other users,
                although it may remain elsewhere in the system where:

                    it immediately (in this case, your content will be removed
                    within a maximum of 90 days after you delete it); Or
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  <ol>

                      systems);
                    </li>
                    <li>

                      of evidence; Or

                  <p>
                    In this case, the material will not be kept longer than is
                    necessary to serve the purposes for which it is retained
                    (the exact duration varies from case to case). In each of
                    the above cases, this license shall remain in force until
                    the Content is completely removed.

          <h4>4. Additional Provisions</h4>
          <h5>Updating Our Terms</h5>

          <p>
            We put our constant and sincere efforts to upgrade our services and
            develop new features to add value to our products for you and your
            community. For this, we may need to update these Terms from time to
            time to clearly reflect our services and processes. We will make
            changes only if existing provisions are no longer relevant or if
            they are incomplete and only if those changes are reasonable and
            take into account your interests.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to legally required changes, we will notify you of
            changes to these Terms at least 30 days in advance (for example, by
            email or through our Products) and before they become effective.
            Will offer you an opportunity to review them. If you continue to use
            our products after any of the updated terms are in effect, you will
            be bound to abide by them.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope that you will continue to use our products, but you can
            delete your account at any time if you do not agree to our updated
            Terms and no longer wish to remain part of the Poker Social
            community.
          </p>

          <h5>2. Suspension or Termination of Account</h5>
          <p>
            We want Poker Social to be a place where people feel happy to visit
            and can safely express themselves and share their thoughts and
            ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we discover that there is a violation of our Terms and Policies
            clearly, seriously, or repeatedly, specifically including the
            violation of our Community Standards, then we may disable or
            permanently suspend access to or suspend your account for a specific
            time. We may suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly
            violate the property rights of others or where we discover it
            necessary by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before taking such action, we will notify you and will brief you
            about all choices offered to you to request a re-review, which may
            prevent us or a user from taking legal action. Doesn't have to be
            compelled to bear the responsibility; hurt our user community, risk
            or impair the integrity or operation of our services, systems or
            product, or wherever we are not bound by technical limitations; or
            unless the law restricts us to do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you delete your account, or we have a tendency to disable it,
            these terms of the agreement between you and us can terminate,
            however, the subsequent provisions can stay in place: 3, 4.2, 4.5.
          </p>

          <h5>3. Limitations of Liability</h5>
          <p>
            We work day and night to supply the most effective services or
            products and provide clear tips to everybody who uses them. However,
            we give you our services or products "as is" and that we build no
            guarantees that they'll invariably be safe, harmless, or error-free
            or that they'll operate without any interference, interruption, or
            imperfection. To the extent allowable by law, we have a tendency to
            conjointly disclaim all warranties, whether categorical or
            understood, together with understood warranties of state, fitness
            for a selected purpose, copyright, and non-infringement. We tend to
            not manage or direct what individuals do or say and that we don't
            manage their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any
            content they share (abusive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and
            alternative together with objectionable content).
          </p>
          <p>
            We cannot predict when there might occur a problem or issue with our
            product. Consequently, our liability is restricted to the utmost
            extent allowable by applicable law, and under no circumstances, we
            could incur any loss of profit, income, data, or information arising
            from or about these Terms or the Poker Social service or product, or

            retaliative or incidental damages, even though we've been warned of
            the likelihood of such damages.
          </p>
          <h5>4. Difference</h5>
          <p>
            We try our best to offer you clear rules that minimize the scope of
            disputes between you and Poker Social. If there's still a dispute or
            controversy, it will be helpful if we get informed about it in
            advance and understand before wherever it will be resolved and what
            laws will apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're a user of our services or products or a consumer, the laws
            of your country of residence will apply to any claim, if you have an
            explanation for action or dispute against Poker Social which is

            legal provisions, shall be subject to the laws of the Republic of

              authority to alter your accountâ€™s username in case someone
              claims that username, and it sounds completely different from the
              one you use in your daily life). In case we do this, we inform you
